1.                                Introduction

===============================================================================


Based upon the fictitious game featured in the movie, “Big”, this text-adventure
game is designed to bring that game to life and recall a game genre of days 
gone by.


===============================================================================

2.                                Walkthrough

===============================================================================


**SPOILER ALERT** The walkthrough does contain spoilers, including images that give away certain plot points, so do not read past this point if you don't want to read or see anything about the game adventure.

The game starts in front of the cave. You are standing at the entrance of a dark cave. Go IN. You find yourself inside the cave. Dim light filters in from outside. It is damp, the walls glisten with some sort of moisture, and a wicked smell permeates the air. LOOK. You see two passageways, one is WEST and one is SOUTH. 

Go WEST into the Tunnel and LOOK. You will see a LANTERN. GET (or TAKE)LANTERN. This
will add the LANTERN to your INVENTORY. The LANTERN is good for ONE USE only, so use
it only when it is needed!

Go SOUTH into the Dark Pit Room. LOOK. It is Dark!! USE (or LIGHT) LANTERN. You see a glass vial, glowing green in the dank, darkness of the pit. It seems to contain a POTION of some sort. AHA!! It’s a green potion of life, this will increase your Health if used just before battle!! GET (or TAKE) POTION will add this to your INVENTORY.

Go EAST you will find yourself in the passageway (this is where you would have gone directly from just inside the cave entrance had you chosen GO SOUTH.) LOOK. You see another vial glimmering in the corner of the passageway. TAKE (or GET) POTION. This will add the POTION to your INVENTORY.  Ahhh, perfect! It’s a BLUE POTION OF STRENGTH!! This will aid you in battle. Like the other POTION, it is one use only, so wait to CONSUME (or USE) POTION, in the cavern of the ice wizard, and your attack_points will be increased in order to defeat the wizard.

GO EAST. You are standing in the cavern of the Evil Wizard. All around you are the carcasses of slain ice dwarves. CONSUME (or USE) HEALTH POTION and STRENGTH POTION. When the wizard appears, MELT WIZARD. How do you want to melt the wizard?
THROW THERMAL POD. The Thermal Pod melts the wizard. His shrieks of pain shake the cave. You win!
